The main point of this program is that it tells you the names of
the artists that appear on the top 200 list for Spotify and they 
are saved into a linked list which is a playlist and we did it for
four weeks. So in our program we created four different linked lists.
Another technique that we used in this program is that we created a queue stack
so that we can get multiple songs into one playlist by scanning each song 
one by one and 200th being on the bottom and number 1 being on top of the stack.
Also in this program we made a song history list and the methods for this class were
lastListened() which returned the last listened song and printHistory() which prints
the song list history.
